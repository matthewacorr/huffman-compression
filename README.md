# huffman-compression
---------------------
A C# program used to create and display huffman trees at runtime.

Usage:
- Enter a string of valid characters (a-z,A-Z, ) and the program will use a huffman compression algorithm to return an encoded string

Todo:
- Allow the program to accept any ACSII character.

Known Bugs:
- None that I'm aware of
